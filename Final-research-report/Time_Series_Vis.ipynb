Aromas are of sweet malts, raisins, candi sugar, spices like cinnamon, nutmeg and clove. Sweet malty taste, spices, fall fruits, molasses. It kind of reminds me of a less carbonated Trois Pistoles. Crisp, clean and smooth mouthfeel. Not as carbonated which is nice. Very good drinkability. This is the first pro-am I have had, and it is a great one to start with.'},\n",

The beer is quite a dark brown, almost black color that shows a brilliantly clear, rich ruby hue to it when held up to the light.  The aroma has a fruitiness to it up front, but then has a meaty malt character to it that is a bit surprising to me.  Aromas of toasted, roasted, almost smoky, dark malt a deep toasted nuttiness (almost like peanut butter).  After a bit the nutty note in the finish seems like it has gone a little rancid.  The aroma on this is not bad, but it is really interesting, I have never quite smelled a beer like this before.\\t\\tLightly sweet, again with a fruit note that reminds me of prunes and raisins.  The beer picks up a hint of tartness in the middle that continues to accentuated the fruit flavors.  This beer feels a little light as it first hits the tongue, but it picks up a viscousness as it rolls across the tongue and actually finishes with a fair amount of heft.  That interesting, slightly rancid nuttiness of the aroma is much subdued in the flavor; there is a touch of it here that is almost more of an oral-nasal sense than anything.  Dark malt notes tend to temper that dark fruit notes a bit and also provide a touch of burnt grain bitterness as well as a touch of burnt acidity and perhaps some tannic astringency.  This could use some spiciness to it; it is somehow Belgian-style and some fermentation spiciness would provide a lot more balance to this beer.  As the beer warms up the fruitiness begins to take on a cola like edge.\\t\\tOther than the fact that the aroma is really starting to annoy me, this isnt a bad beer; I keep on thinking I should be able to exactly identify this note in the aroma, but I cant quite place my finger on it.'},\n",

       "  'review/text': 'Black ales and black lagers are elusive specimens, so I am very pleased to partake of a Belgian inspired black ale. Into her dark depths do I prepare to surrender my soul.\\t\\ther sinisterly seductive liquid fills my glass a dark brown with slight light glinting through along the sides of the glass; a faint amber hue. Not too much head, but an almost immediate brussels lace trail sticks to the sides of my glass. Her nose is lightly sweet with yeast and fresh fall apples. A touch of spice adds to the mix. My first quaff is full of bready chewiness and a smooth, slightly oily body. Faint effervescence prevents Sinister Minister from being too thick and overly cloying, though she definitely has a full body and mouthfeel. a bit more of a sweet and sour twang in the palate as opposed to the nose, leaving an almost lingering sour yeast pucker in the finish. A touch of banana notes alongside the crisp fall apples and spice.\\t\\tOverall, an intriguing brew. The Belgian style element really changes this black ale from something ordinarily extraordinary into something unusually extraordinary. A bit confused I think as I was left not quite sure the overall impression the Barley Island Sinister Minister Belgian Black Ale was going for, but I do know I enjoyed it. Good; could maybe use a wee bit of fine-tuning, but not much. I would drink it again.'},\n",

       "  'review/text': 'Bottle shared by GMCC2181. Pour was brown to black w/ some reddish hues to it too (when tilted). The head was 1cm and had good retention, steady bubbles rising to the surface. The aroma was coriander spices, oranges, light yeast, some dark fruits. The flavor followed the aroma, nice fruity esters, phenolic spicing, coriander, oranges, mixed dark fruits, and light chocolate and faint smoke/roast in the aftertaste. This sucker had some nice flavors going on, and the only knock was the light (filtered?) mouthfeel combined with seemingly high artificial carbonation. Fix up the latter, and weve got ourselves a very fine beer here - enjoyable as is, though. Thanks, Gabe, for sharing!'},\n",

The nose really reminds me of a brown ale - notes of toffee, flat caramel and semi-sweet chocolate are abound.  The belgian yeast adds some light, fruity esthers that add an interesting dimension.  The body is chewy with an onslaught of sweet malts.  Notes of caramel and baked brown initially hit the tongue.  The yeast takes on a bigger role here, adding deep fruits, overripe banana, plums and more.  Drinks well and has an interesting complexity.'},\n",

       "  'review/text': '12oz bottle poured in a shaker.  I found this bottle in a small liquor store in Granite City, Illinois.  I bought it as part of a pick-n-pack combination.  BIB IPA pours murky orange with large pulp and a medium semi-soapy looking head.  The combination of the pulp and the murkiness is a bit disconcerting if youve never had an unfiltered beer.  Even with experience the darker beer color doesnt look appetizing.  The nose is mostly hop-generated citrus with a very faint malt tone.  The body is oily and surprisingly thick for an IPA but it works well.   The hop bitterness is quite prevalent, pushing most other flavors to the side.  A touch of heather or clover peeks through though.  This beer isnt bad but the bitterness is more reminiscent of an imperial IPA than a straight IPA.  This is probably a local favorite but falls just a little shy when compared to some of the American great IPAs.'},\n",

Im not entirely sure what that means, but this was a very drinkable beer that would make a nice session beer...  Barly IPA pours out in a thick looking stream.  It is dark amber and opaque in the glass.  It has a dense, frothy, and lasting beige head that also leaves some lacing.  The aroma is orange, citrus, and sweet pinapple.  The flavor has a smooth, malty backbone balanced by a juicy citrus bitterness.  The bitterness level is fairly substantial, but isnt offensive since it is so well balanced by the hefty, sweet caramel  maltiness.  Not only is the flavor great, but this beer is smooth on the palate and has a nearly creamy texture.  The body is medium to medium-full.  This is a great IPA and really underrated, in my opinion.  \\t12 oz bottle from The Hop Shop in Indianapolis, Indiana.  Shared with Rob at our weekly/bi-weekly beer tasting.'},\n",

       "  'review/text': '2006 bottle from MI2CA drunk on 1/11/07Cant figure out the bottling methods of these guys.  It says unfiltered/unpasteurized on the bottles, though it dosent say bottle conditioned.  The bottle of barrel-aged oatmeal stout was one of the most filtered, watery, loose tasting beers Ive ever had nor did it have any sediment.  This one, howver, has some definite protein dropout, which despite my best efforts got in to my glass, and the very last shot in the bottle (for experimentation) is completely cloudy.  The ruby-auburn-tinged caramel body is light on carbonation, though a fair amount of dark beige head does form, showing medium retention and little/no lacing.Sweet cherries and strawberries in the nose brush against the nose rather coarsely, while leafy, green hop aromatics provide grapefruit and orange rind notes.  Definite crystal maltiness sweetens things to a point, then seems to harden and dry out, with light yeast doughiness and moderate breadiness.  Every subsequent smell, however, is alive with fresh hop aromatics, fruity esters and balanced, sweet malt, it just seems to suffer on the finish, somewhat.  So based on the aroma, I suppose the evidence is in favor of it being unpasteurized at least.  Well have to leave it to the flavor/texture to determine the rest.Bittersweet malt and hops collide, with a strong earthiness and tangy grapefruit flavors that both give way to a ruby red grapefruit sweetness mixed with cherries and moderate herbal notes.  Whatever the medium malt being used, it comes across clearly and quite well.  The caramel-toffee sweetness is well matched and for once some hop acidity is much appreciated in balancing it.  Mostly substantial texture, with moderately engaging carbonation.  Ok, Ill buy that this stuff is lightly to not filtered and just conditioned well.  Not sure on the carbonation, I suspect its forced, but thats ok, Ill let them off the hook for that.  It comes across well enough.'},\n",

Pours a pleasing orangey IPA color, with the carbonation surging into a fluffy head that shortly dissolves to lacing. Pretty clear until you spot the microscopic Bells-type floaties. Taste to my mind is again more of big resiny pine boughs than citrus. But still, its very tasty and filling, and brings out the malts, which appear to be a tad darker in roast than other IPA, a bit more caramel and over-toasted bagel. Its very enjoyable, and distinctive, especially for a bottled IPA. My label says \"Tavern style India Pale Ale.\" I have never found a tavern with anything this good.'},\n",

The aroma was very floral, with the summit hops coming through strongly.  The flavor is well balanced.  A good mixture of hops and malts makes it a really smooth beer, but with enough hops to please most hopheads.  I look forward to this one in bottles!'},\n",

Slightly hazed orange color with a small, foamy head. Something about the hops/malt balance in this beer reminds me of an American  barleywine though, of course, at a much more moderate level. The malts are more dominant but the hops are strong and cant be ignored. Its sweet w/ melon and pine hop notes along w/ a gentle iced tea astringency. By the end of my glass I am definitely ready to say that this is not an IPA but, whatever it is, I like it just fine. Its well balanced in its own way and while its not the most vibrant thing in the world, I cant complain about anything.'},\n",

Thought this was going to be another boring brown ale, but this one is at least sessionable at the very least.'},\n",

One finger of frothy beige head with poor retention and a small ring of lacing.\\t\\t4.0 S: Loads of nut flavor, toasty, biscuity malts, and a touch of toffee. Hops add a small amount of earthy quality. Rather dry with a low fruitiness, but overall pretty nice.\\t\\t4.0 T: Taste is much like the nose. Nutty, toasty, biscuity malts, and toffee are all there again. Theres a barely detectable almost buttery flavor (though not exactly buttery) than complements the flavors well. A little sweeter than the nose suggests, but not much. Hops are mainly earthy with a touch of citrus.\\t\\t4.0 M: Medium body. Good moderate spritzy carbonation. Somewhat slippery creaminess and quite smooth. \\t\\t4.5 D: Based on the scores for this, this was a wonderful surprise. Overall a very solid brown ale that I wouldnt mind drinking from time to time.

Pine hops up front in the nose w/ an woody undercurrent. Hop bitterness is firm but a bit on the soapy side. Really not bad though. The biggest problem this beer has is that its overcarbonated which makes it come across as a bit watery and drowns out any sort of malt depth this might otherwise have. It is very sharp on the tong which detracts from drinkability somewhat as well. There seems like there is a decent beer going on somewhere here but the flaws override most anything enjoyable about it.'},\n",

       "  'review/text': '8/04/2008:  Dirty Helen Tavern Style Brown Ale is brown in color with golden highlights and a thin, speckly veil.  A faint caramelly-molasses-nutty aroma is barely evident.  The flavor is even more elusive which is okay based on what can be found which includes: steeped roasted malt or bark, sour/burnt malt and fruit but sometimes vacantly sweet, and something slightly nutty.  Weird.  Doesnt even quite cut it to be just \"average\".  This beer feels overly thin and watery on the palate and is completely unexciting.  Overall this is a very disappointing beer that misses the mark.  I am quite surprised by how poor this particular beer is considering the quality of several of Barley Islands other offerings, most noteably the Barfly IPA and Majic Java Stout...\\t12 fl. oz. bottle from tish.  Thanks!  Rating #69 for this beer...'},\n",

The nose is of a somewhat astringent burnt caramel that transitions to an \"off\" phenolic/plastic note; not terribly enticing. The mouthfeel is on the light side of medium-bodied and almost creamy-slick, finishing mildly dry and astringent. The flavor follows the nose with an additional roasted nut note. This is a decent brown, but the astringency and plastic note detract from the overall effect. Its not bad, but its not particularly good either.'},\n",

The beer has a fruity & alcoholic start with a roasted coffee finish.  The medium body is creamy and very soft.  The finish feels chalky.'},\n",

The aroma has notes of chocolate, smoked, nutty malts, oatmeal, prune, coffee, and some grassy hops. The flavor profile is sweet mocha,  toasted grain, walnut, with a light background of acidic fruit and some mild bitterness. The aftertaste does display a bit more hop and coffee bitterness but not much. The mouth feel is medium bodied, slightly oily and carbonated just right matching the flavors. Well not huge or earth shattering, a solid Oatmeal Stout and quite drinkable. Worth another try, could be really good if found on hand pump.'},\n",

First warm day of a Carolina spring and I want a roasty oatmeal stout? Eh, whatever. At any rate, I found it pleasant and unassuming. The nose is somewhat modest, decent roasted notes and a hint of creamy chocolate. Fizzy body is a bit of a surprise, given the style, and indeed its just a touch too thin for me. Nicely chalky finish, just like the coffee cousin. But the flavor profiles not nearly as complex as Id like it to be, even for a style made to session. Enjoyable even so, and big ups to Josh for giving me a chance to taste this.'},\n",

Pours perfect black, with 2 finger creamy head. Smells of toffee, chocolate, and wonderful roasted malt. Nice. Tastes of toffee, chocolate, deep roasted malt & to my surprise, not much a coffee note. Its there, but blocked by the sweetness. I found my favorite oatmeal stout as of now, downed 2 bottles of it, and really enjoyed every drop. Nicely done guys!'},\n",

The aroma picked up lightly-roasted semi-sweet chocolates, toasted oatmeal, and more charred black malts.. dusty overall with a bit of detergent character that detracted a bit.  The flavor had roasted sweeter chocolates and rolled oats with darker chocolates and coffee more toward the back.. coffee provided light-moderate bitterness, and carries through the short, but enjoyable finish.

Aroma is mild with a scent of roasted malt.  Color is a deep black.  Taste is dry and toasted.  Starting with a medium body it goes down with a crisp roasted taste coming on and smooth feel.  Finish come is with a bright roasted flavor that turns to a bitter burnt taste and ends with a dry bitterness.

A great balance of flavors going on too, nice malty notes with delicious citrus fruits dancing around. Not as strong as a Dreadnaught or 90min, but this has a lot of character to make up for it.

       "  'review/text': 'I am not a fan of Scotch Ales, but this was a nice one. Aroma is full of nuttiness and Jack Daniels, with a touch of smoke and toffee. Flavor is smooth, notes of vanilla, wood, toffee, roasted malt, with a hint of yeast. Lots of Jack Daniels flavor, but very little of the alcohol or booze, which was nice. Whiskey worked hand in hand with the wood to create a nice complexity. The carmel from the barrels balanced everything out nicely, and added a nice smokiness to the finish. Quite nice.'},\n",

The flavor has a little more roast and a little less chocolate. Seems that most of the barrel is in the finish. It dries out real nice. Medium body with average carbonation. Easy to drink. Pretty nice. Surprising evenEarlier Rating: 7/6/2006 Total Score: 3.322 ounce bottle.  Poured with an overblown fizzy tan head.  Opaque dark brown to black.  Looks very thin.  Very light aroma of vanilla, oak, and bourbon.  Slight sweet roasted quality.  The bourbon flavor is about right.  It blends well with the roasted notes form the beer.  Medium/light body on the tongue.  Silky.   Overall, this is quality beer, but not special.'},\n",

Big crass aroma of bourbon, chocolate and coffee grinds with notes of vanilla and leather/dirt.

Poured a clear, deeper brown with a cool swirly dusting of deep beige head and what appeared to be legs running down the sides of the glass.  The aroma definitely focused on the barrel aspect, with sweet vanilla, bourbon, and lightly-charred oak representin... although none of these characteristics were abrasive, and the underlying stout was quite nice with medium-roasted chocolate and mild lactic notes.  The flavor had nice roasty chocolate again at the core with some sweet oats.. barrel accent was very well executed with vanilla bean and bourbon accents.. finish was somewhat long, beginning with roasted bakers chocolate and transitioning to sweet bourbon, oak char, and mild lactic sourness.  About medium-bodied on the palate with higher carbonation (a touch too high.. filling up the mouth too rapidly).  All in all a very good beer!'},\n",

The color of the beer is nearly black and is has a small frothy tan-colored head.  The flavor is really smooth and mellow as the vanilla, roasted and caramelized malts, chocolate, and slightly dry bourbon and charred wood mend together.  This beer has a medium to medium-full body and is quite smooth with a bit of a creamy texture.  This particular bottle is much better than the first one I had.  That one was really bland and unexciting.  This one really has some barrel aged aromas and flavors as the vanilla and some slight bourbon notes are definitely noticeable.  This beer isnt stellar, but it is still quite tasty for being a barrel-aged oatmeal stout.  It is really well-balanced and although it might not be high in alcohol, it is still a good deal at only $4.49+tax per bomber!  This is a solid sessionable barrel-aged oatmeal stout (first one?) at that price and probably the cheapest \"barrel-aged\" beer available!\\t22 fl. oz. bottles from Westside Wine and Liquors in West Harrison, Ohio.

The aroma has barrel wood notes, sweet bourbon and mild chocolate to go along with roasty notes and faint oxidation in the background.

Pours a very dark chocolate brown color; huge, textured, medium tan head with great retention and fine-bubbled, glistening lacing; a beautiful pour.  Smells like lightly toasted oak, vanilla extract, and lots of slightly warming bourbon in the aroma; the sweet vanilla can seem a bit much, and the bourbon comes on strong at first.  Medium mouthfeel: loads of warming bourbon, milk chocolate, and toasty oak and vanilla; the bourbon and oakiness is a bit beyond the chocolatey, light stout underneath; but theres really nothing overly harsh or astringent here, surprisingly; a warming, reasonably tasty milk chocolate stout.  Medium finish, toasty oak, vanilla, soft bourbon and wood, with plenty of chocolate.'},\n",

       "  'review/text': 'Bottle (650ml) shared at Biegamans Summer Gathering -- my bottle courtesy of lewis13. Pours black with ruby hues and an average size somewhat-lasting light-brown head. Aroma of bourbon (but thankfully not too much) along with chocolate, some roastness, oats and oak. The bourbons even more subtle in the flavour which is nice (thats how it should be!) along with sweet malt, chocolate, oak, some hops and a mild bitter finish. Medium bodied. This is bourbon barrel-aged done right, its not overpowering. I really enjoyed it.'},\n",

       "  'review/text': '22oz. Bottle\\t$4.99\\tBig Red Bloomington\\t\\tPoured the darkest brown body you could imagine. So close to black its hard to tell the difference. A 1+ finger chocolate head formed on the pour that quickly faded to a whispy cap with thick edges. Leaves sticky thin drink lines with each sip that slowly fall back into the body. This beer looks good but menecing at the same time.\\t\\tThe aroma starts off with a solid base of malt. Coffee beans and bittersweet chocolate are both present and very enjoyable. A perfect blend of vanilla bean, some musty wood, and mild bourbon come in flashes over the malts. This is a wonderful warm smelling beer.\\t\\tThe flavor is all in the aroma. The chocolate maltiness starts things off and is quickly followed by coffee beans at mid-palate. The coffee beans follow through to the finish and are accompanied by lightly roasted grains. The vanilla and mild bourbon leave a very pleasant coating that lasts a few seconds after the swallow. Leaves a mildly bitter coffee aftertaste.\\t\\tMedium body with a nice creaminess from the barrel aging. Sluggish carbonation lets the beer work through at its own pace. \\t\\tThis is definately a highly drinkable beer. Very enjoyable and not heavy like most of the barrel aged stouts you run into. Lower abv lets you enjoy a few glasses without being too much.\\t\\tThis beer is a huge surprise. I saw the average score before I reviewed and after sampling this bottle I really cant understand why its so low. This is a wonderful beer. If its retired I hope they plan to bring it back at some point. Really well made beer.\\t\\tNotes: I read through some other reviews after I wrote this one. Many said the bourbon was way too strong. I sat on this bottle for probably 4-5 months.\\t\\t3/3/07'},\n",

That dominates the flavor, and a dry and ashy espressoish stout hides behind it.  Medium-bodied with a rather dry mouthfeel, and a bit boozy for 6%, from all the bourbon I guess.

It took 4 series of pouring and waiting for the head to subside to get 3/4s of a glass.  The flavor is kind of odd.  Some swallows the bourbon is up front and others it is in the finish.  I dont know that Ive experienced that before.  There is some chocolate in there, as well.  Fairly thin for the style and lacking the creaminess that is typical for an Oatmeal Stout.  Interesting as most bourbon-aged beers are.  Another rater said that it is too small for the bourbon and that may be true.  Hopefully theyll stick with it and tweak it.  Shows promise.'},\n",

       "  'review/text': '2005 bottle shared with SuIIy on 11/23/05.  The bottle says it is unfiltered and unpasteurized, but yet, the beer pours the most fizzy, clear thing I have seen lately.  If this isnt forced carbonation, than its the strangest natural carbonation Ive ever experienced.  Deep cola brown, somewhat dull, not much in the auburn-red tinged department, as some deeper colored stouts have.  Tan-beige head is mountainous and very very slow to recede.  Lacing present.  Aroma of straight bourbon, dry and lightly alcoholic, with light vanilla and very dry wood.  Hints of bakers chocolate, some light yeast and very little else.  No sweet malt, no creamy oat-like notes, no hops.  Flavor is full bourbon.  Hints of peanut skins, salt, seltzer water and alcohol.  Pure bourbon, dry wood and light roast.  Its not that the bourbon is overdone here, its just that the beer is underdone.  No malt sugars, little if any chocolate or roast.  Body seems very filtered, though they say it is not.  Carbonation is omnipresent, sharp, obtrusive and very high.  Texture is watery, loose, prickly and thin on end.  As it warms, the aroma takes on a note of glue or hot plastic.'},\n",

Pours a nice black color with a foamy brown head. Seems very fizzy and carbonated. Nose is mainly bourbon with a slight bit of chocolate seeping through. Flavor is all bourbon, a little bit woody and some more bourbon. Lacking here, nothing good happening and the bourbon has taken this beer hostage. No solid stout characteristics remain and its like drinking a carbonated glass of watered down bourbon. BA is not always successful.'},\n",

Well I know I let this beer cellar for too long by the secondary fermentation that took place in the bottle, hence the massive head (Freds brother) I have this problem with Shipyards Bluefin Stout. Its unfiltered, and once the beer warms to about 70F it starts a secondary and becomes over carbonated. \\t Nevertheless, the aging must have toned down the bourbon presence; although it is still dominate. The flavor has rounded very nicely. Massive notes of toasted oak, vanilla, hazelnut, chocolate, coffee, and bourbon duhhhh! Downside the palate is feeble; thin and lacking punch.

The feel is quite lively and aggressive, a tad overcarbonated and thin. Needs more oatmeal for body. Overall, I liked it but could see how others may be disappointed.

Toasted oatmeal when it warms along with oak woody notes and hints of vanilla.  Very smooth complex aroma IMHO!  Well balanced flavor with roasty & vanilla flavor; Chocolate & caramel  with resiny hop. Whiskey in the finish & aftertaste, but more subtle than the aroma.  finish is on the malty sweet side.  Minimal fruitiness.  Medium high carbonation...way too much for the type of beer that this is.  A little dry in the mouth, very thin, probably due to over carbonation.

Moderate roastiness and moist soil notes. Fuzzy carbonation. Tannins add some firmness to the slick body. Soft cottony roastiness embraces the  delicate bourbon flavors. Brief earthy hop appearance at the heart of the brew. Rich toasted wood undertones couple with charred malts, adding even more firmness to the flavor. Bourbon is remarkably clean and perfumey, yet sweet enough to withstand the harsh malts and brighten the aforementioned subtleties of the whiskey. Gentle notes of vanilla and caramel cushion the vague acidity. Toasted wood and chalky black malts deepen the bourbon flavors in the finish with their resilient dryness. Delicate remnants of vanilla and black malt hulls on the tongue. This could benefit from a heartier aroma and more body/creamier carbonation. Otherwise, this is very well balanced and packs a delicious bourbon flavor.'},\n",

The flavor is rich with strong roasted tones and hints of bourbon in smooth proportions. The body is a bit weak and crys out for just a touch more kick, although well within the limits of a sweet stout. This is clearly one of the most uniquely flavored stouts around and is a pleasure to drink.'},\n",

       "  'review/text': 'This was an interesting find at a roadside liquor store in Kokomo, Indiana.  My first impression was that this is very reminiscent of the Dark Horse stouts- it pours very dark (but not so \"molassesy\" as Dark Horse stouts) with a large tan to light brown head.  Nice complexity in the aroma- licorice, toasty sweet malt, molasses, and bourbon.  Bourbon comes up big in the flavor too, with woody, vanilla notes that complement some sweet roast and licorice.  Also had a slightly smoky flavor.  Very good but needs a bulkier body and a denser palate to reach excellence.'},\n",

Thick, rich, and creamy bourbon and chocolate. A light burnt coffee, vanilla-oak, and some molasses. Mainly malty with lots of chocolate and the sweet bourbon isnt overly oaky and not boozey at all. Flavor is thinner than I anticipated, but thats only because the aroma smelled so thick. Lots of wood, chocolate, and vanilla up front with some sweet bourbon. The bourbon blends nicely with the rest of the flavors and doesnt stand out as much as the aroma. Some charred coffee grows slightly into the finish along with more bourbon and sweet malts. Finishes with a dry, woody, coffee, malty, bourbon sweetness and a hint of acidity. Fairly lengthy aftertaste following a medium body and moderate, fizzy carbonation. Overall, a pretty nice barrel-aged stout. Fairly sweet with a nice charred flavor. Enjoyable.'},\n",

Lightish-bodied, if that can be believed! Relatively thin mouthful with a lot of oak and bourbon at first with some mild malt, bitter nuts and a twang of vanilla at the end. Aftertaste is mild, some alcohol is noticeable, but mainly a light finish of bourbon and roasted malt - nice, since its not so strong! Overall, a very well done beer that showcases the flavours and doesnt get drowned out by the alcohol! The smaller sized bottle is another plus - perfect for the style, and this isnt even strong, so thats perfect. Id recommend this to others and will pick up the Porter the next time Im in Chicago. I sampled this twelve ounce bottle purchased from West Lakeview Liquors in Chicago, Illinois on 15-December-2008, sampled at home in Washington on 17-May-2010.'},\n",

       "  'review/text': 'Dark dark brown to black with a quickly diminishing tan head.  The nose is vanilla, chocolate and roast.  A bit sweet, but that might be the bourbon barrel vanilla as much as the beer.  Full creamy mouth, slightly higher than average carbonation.  Creamy and malty sweet.  Noticeable, but not dominating vanilla, ala bourbon.  Chocolate and roast backfill.  Fruity acidity in the finish.  Long lingering charcoal roast.  Perhaps the slightest hint of bourobn after the aftertaste.  Not bad.Earlier Rating: 4/17/2007 Total Score: 3.2Pours a dark dark brown with a thin tan head, thinning to nothing but a glass hugging  brown foam.  The nose is very boozy.  I know its just the barrel, but the nose makes me think alcohol.  Whiskey, a little wood, a little chocolate malt, floral hops, something green seems a bit off.  The mouthfeel is about average for the style, low carbonation and a hint of thickness, but not too chewy, not too fizzy.  The flavors are in line with the aroma, but the alcohol seems to come out a bit more.  I have a hard time believing the ABV is < 5.  Chocolate malt character over the whiskey slightly woody flavor.  The alcohol whiskey element is so sweet, a little hoppy, not much roast, but a little acidic.  Boozy finish, whiskey aftertaste.  The whiskey flavors balance the sweetness, but I find this to be a bit much.'},\n",

Full bodied with almost chewy carbonation. Flavor is suggestive of those expensive Paradox barrel stouts. Notes of chocolate, wood, bourbon and vanilla. Whoops. I just figured out why barrel is in the name. Finishes smooth and somewhat astringent - or maybe thats my mouth trying to suck up the last flavor bits from my gums. Seriously, it is very good.

But I did want to try this at GABF, but never got around to it with all the other good beers around.  Then a shining opportunity came when Schroppfy rated this and well he had a bottle for me to rate, score!  Well, this pours completely black and very thick.  The visible thickness of the beer is a welcomed surprise. The head is small but strong with a sticky thick lacing.  The head itself is a nice brown color.  The aroma has a lot of chocolate and strong wood alcohol essence but the alcohol is not too strong for the thick, lightly roasted stout-y aspects.  Also there is a thick cereal sweetness.  In the taste that wood alcohol essence grows, so it interferes with the other chocolate flavors.  However, the my favorite part is the mouthfeel on this brew. Its just so thick and lusciously velvety.  There is a reduced carbonation and it is tongue coating.  I feel like the Venoms alien symbiote is taking over my tongue.  This is probably the best BA low alcohol beer I have ever had, not much competition there though. Hmmm... now I need the Beastie Barrel Porter, damn my vanity. 12oz bottle into a Chimay miniature goblet.'},\n",

It really brings the malt flavor to a head. I love the way it becomes complicated, but not overly so. Doesnt hurt that Buffalo Trace is a great Kentucky Bourbon.

       "  'review/text': '12oz bottle from StFun, as part of the latest round of NP10. Thanks, Josh!!! Oh how I love coffee flavors in a stout. This one has a big roasty nose, rich toasted malts with a strong barrel presence to it as well. The pour is moderate, with a decent tan head and prickly carbonation. The bourbon tends to dominate a bit too much in the taste, overwhelming some of whats there in the solid base beer. Mouthfeel is slightly thin too. But its a decent brew that Im glad to have tried.'},\n",

A lingering coffee aftertaste follows with a faint metallic note in the background. The coffee flavor in this beer seems just a little \"off\" while on the tongue but is dead on in the aftertaste.

The aroma is full of dark roasted coffee, black patent malt, and roast.  The flavor is a little too heavy on the burnt malt, lending an ashy chalkiness that overpowers the coffee and roast notes.  The coffee does come out nicely on the finish.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied, watery in texture, but not thin, with moderate soft fizzy carbonation.  This was OK, but not up there with my favorite coffee beers.  A far cry from Bells Java.'},\n",

Aroma heightens the anticipation, emitting black fudge brownies, unrefined mocha beans covered in dark chocolate, hints of Madagascar vanilla bean and baked mocha torte sauce. Flavor onsets with too much frits and feverishly dissipates across the palate. Astringent edges curtail around the outer realm while a charred, French roast coffee flavor gets hard pressed to the top of burnt brownies. Hallow in all areas, and at its best in the sweetened vanilla mocha finish. Stretched too far to make an impact. Thanks for bringing it, MrFacto!'},\n",

Although totally one dimensional, the coffee that dominates the aroma is really pleasant and smells quite fresh. Also noted are sweet and black malts, oats, a sugary component that just feels like sugar added to coffee. This nose is very pleasant, bold too, just so lopsided. Quite tasty. Roasty coffee pervades, followed by well balanced roasted grains in good quantity, mild chocolate and milder still vanilla to round things out. Finishes off dry and mildly roasty. The bitterness that lingers throughout keeps this beer balanced and makes it incredibly quaffable. Nicely surprising, a well done coffee beer.'},\n",

Its super concentrated...one of the most powerfully coffee smelling beers youll sniff. One dimendsional? You bet, but it smells good. The body is basically black with a few hints at a ruddy dark brown. The head is dimishing, mocha colored and starts about a thumb thick. Bitter/acidic coffee fore. Very dark coffee/dark chocolate in the fore. It then gets sweet with cream, milk chocolate and sweet malt through the middle. There are also bitter roast malt and coffee accents on into the finish and what may be a pretty healthy dose of hops or just the bitterness from the coffee. You like coffee? Then you cant dislike this. Again....fairly one dimensional, but fun to drink.'},\n",

These lead the way in flavor, too.  The bitter coffee profile is a tad overstated, perhaps...but I still liked it.   Some chocolate, roasted maltiness. dark fruits, and oatmeal round out the flavors.  The mouthfeel was a little too thin for my liking...as others have pointed out before me.

The nose detects a lot of espresso, roasted and burnt malt, oat, chocolate, plum, a hint of pepper, and grassy hops. The taste profile is one that starts coffee-ish and mostly stays that way throughout the tasting. What helps is an addition of fruity rind acidity and some hop character along with a dash of ashy yeast character. The finish is quite bitter and dry. The mouth feel is thinner than that of the regular Oatmeal stout for some reason, maybe the coffee bitterness gives a sense of thinness. It is very oily however. A good brew and I like it because I like coffee stouts but the average person may not care for a much, not subdued for sure.'},\n",

It opens with a very coffee-grounds aroma, and the initial flavors reflect the same tendency to a crass understanding of \"coffee\".  Coffee is best when it balances, smoothens, and rounds out the flavors, not when it bonks your tongue with a sharp bitterness.  But then, Im a guy who tends to drink a cafe mocha--or at least a cup with a cream and a sugar--rather than a black coffee.  But like so many beers, my palate was deadened over time and by the end of the bottle it was more drinkable than it was initially.

       "  'review/text': 'In short: A highly roasted stout (and I mean HIGHLY roasted) balanced by fresh green hops.  Very good.\\tHow: Bottle 12oz, from kmweaver.  Thanks a lot Ken!\\tThe look: Black body topped by a long-lasting small tan head.\\tIn long: Nose is roasted, more roasted, even more roasted.  I could smell the roastiness from 2 feet away and to a lower extent the aroma had some roasted coffee beans.  Taste is more of the same, roasted malts, hightly roasted malts and very highly roasted malts.  All that roastiness would only be ok but where it gets interesting is in the balance part of the beer.  A whole lots of fresh green hops in there was somewhat reminiscent of chewing on hops cone.  Good session beer that has even more burnt flavour than my girlfriends cooking.'},\n",

While it carried with it a really inticing aroma of chocolate covered espresso beans,  treacle, and toffee, the flavor really was a let down.  It had a nice coffee/dark chocolate beginning and then, bam...nothing.  It just dropped off the palate in an instant and what was left reminded me of drinking a seltzer water.  A nice black hue, medium bodied with a one-finger thick tan head.  I think if the beer had more depth of flavor, it would score much higher with me.  Decent beer, but could have been much, much better.'},\n",

The oatmeal not only adds body to this stout but adds a nice smoothness.  The buttery flavor comes out especially well in the finish.  With the medium-to-low alcohol this beer sports you could tag this as a great session beer.  If I were to suggest any improvement it would be to add a touch more oatmeal to balance out the hop & java bean bitterness.

       "  'review/text': '3-5 month old bottle from Shigadeyo, drunk on 11/2/07Black body, with a medium-high clarity and a large, light-tan head showing moderate retention and light lacing.Typical coffee stout aroma, and fortunately, its very aromatic.  Vanilla, fresh beans, dry chocolate notes and tastefully light amounts of caramel collect at the edge of the nose.  Light hop bitterness invigorates the senses and pushes the coffee and malt flavors through to the finish.  Some crispy popcorn-like notes nearly remind of diacetyl, but I dont think there is any here.  Quite dry and with that papery, beany note that is inevitable in coffee stouts.  Hop resins persist on the end, but the smooth choco-vanilla malts do not peter out.  No alcohol noted, medium-high to high strength of aroma.Very soft, but high levels of carbonation lend a creamy-fluffy feel to the body, as light chocolate fudge braces the palate for a big dose of roasty coffee and strong vanilla flavors.  It slowly dries the palate, with help from hop bitterness and slightly astringent black malts.  Caramel sweetness perks up as it warms and breathes, and light looseness in the body is exposed as well.  No alcohol noted and quite drinkable.  Perhaps a little less caramel sweetness and more interplay between vinousness and coffee would help.  I dont see the need for this much pine and citrus bitterness either.'},\n",

The initial aroma is mostly sweet citrus hops with faint sugar. The flavor is very smooth and sweet. Citrus and juicy fruit hops come through as well as dark malt and chocolate. The smoothness adds a nice milk chocolate accent that rounds this out nicely. The finish stays sweet and reminds me of a hopped up orange creamsicle with an alcohol punch.

Black brown with a thin tan film. Huge chocolate, huge bourbon, hugely complex malt but you know what? This has so much finesse its unreal. Im litterally blown away. The balance is utterly superb. NOTHING is even close to being overdone. I am really not used to this in US beers. As an Englishman, this is perfect. Vanilla, liquorice, some peat, earth, wow. This is brilliant. Huge yet cuddly and cute. Big bourbon finish but again its done SO WELL. Bloody excellent. Thanks so much to Grant for this very rare, very special treat.'},\n",

Orangey stream teams with green buds and dry bitterness.  Medium-bodied with curtailing pils malt and a lemon juice flavor shine on grapefruit rind shavings.  Harsh bitterness is never dormant, and quite dominant especially in the end, meeting up with bitter orange peel for the last goodbye.'},\n",
