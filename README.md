# Overview
Series of projects that involved the implementation/application of various strategies in building recommender systems.
Recommender systems included predicting book rating reviews, top beer choices, and beer ratings according to ABV.

# Note
Feel free to look through any of the project folders. 
In particular, I would advise looking at the final research report pdf. 
This report provides a good overview of the various concepts accumulated and applied throughout the duration of the course projects, it is also a quick and interesting read.

# Some Models/strategies: 
- TF-IDF                     -> predicting based on the historical appearance of terms
- Cosine similarity          -> similarities between items/users based on their interactions
- Features                   -> extracting relevant characteristics from item attributes such as test, metadata, keywords, star ratings
- Weighted Features          -> assigning weights to various features based on importance/relevancy to recommendation task
- Word Embeddings (Word2Vec) -> dense vector representation of words
- Bag-of-Words               -> representing a collection of words irrespective of ordering
- Hybrid Approaches          -> combining multiple such models
- Linear and Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes, Markov Chains
- Decision Trees and Random Forests

# Technologies
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python, JSON
- Libraries: Nltk, Sklearn, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scipy
